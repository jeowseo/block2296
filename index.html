                        <p>Block 2296 is located in the North part of Williamsburg Brooklyn. It is surrounded by Wythe Avenue, Berry Street, North 11th Street, and North 10th Street. This block has largely two structures. The west half is old Hecla Iron Works Building (100 N 11th Street), and Vice Media and its sub-companies building (90 N 11th Street).</p>

                        <p>Williamsburg was home of manufacturing starting from 19th Century. Since this block is located in the vicinity of the East River Waterfront and most of the manufacturing businesses back then used maritime transportation, all the building structures were constructed in late 19th century (PLUTO, NYC Department of City Planning). Hecla Iron Works Building was built in 1894. It is now designated as a landmark. The building was the company’s headquarter and was also a showpiece for the types of architectural and ornamental work that the Hecla produced. The company was a main architectural ornament supplier for many of the cast iron buildings in New York City (Landmark Preservation Commission, 2004).</p>

                        <br><br>
                        <p>As manufacturing industries declined in 70s and 80s, these structures became underutilized and remained vacant. Starting from early 1990s, artists who are looking for joint living and working spaces started to move into those structures and because of that, many of manufacturing structures in this neighborhood turned into art production studios. This was really popular among artists because converting old industrial structures into working and living spaces was relatively easy and cheap. Su Friedrich, the director of the documentary film ‘Gut Renovation’ moved to Hecla Iron Works Building In 1989 with her girlfriend and ex-girlfriend.</p>

                        <br><br>
                        <p>In 2005, NYC Department of City Planning rezoned Greenpoint and Williamsburg Waterfront and half of the block was included as a part of the rezoning plan. The city government rezoned the neighborhood from industrial use to residential mixed use. Su Friedrich video documented her experience with new residential development that occurred in Williamsburg after the rezoning. The film ‘Gut Renovation’ is about how once budding artistic community transformed into luxury condos. She continued to film the transformation of the neighborhood until she lost her apartment. Southern part of Hecla building became a luxury loft, and rents for 1 bedroom there is about $5,000 per month (StreetEasy, Compass/).</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>Hecla Iron Works Building converted to mixed use. Before that this building use to have four dance studios, one escape the room company, and it still has  Brooklyn Brewery storage, and North 11th Shoe Repair Shop. I interviewed people who work at shoe repair shop and they say the rent increased abruptly after the rezoning, and most of the business that requires larger spaces left to other parts of Brooklyn.  I sneaked in to the building, looked around, and there were some evidences of dance studios such as big mirrors and wooden floors. Brooklyn Brewery is a longtime tenant and currently uses ground floor as their storage. The actual brewery is across the street.</p>

                        <h3 id="Text3">HYPER-GENTRIFICATION</h3>
                        <br><br>
                        <center><img src= "images\2ndfloor.png" width="800"></center>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>Adidas plans to bring a design studio on a 2nd floor of the building (The Real Deal). The company signed a lease for 20,000 square feet and asking rents in the building were about $70 per square foot (Crain’s). That roughly sums up to $1,400,000. I am not sure if its monthly thing or annual thing but either way that is a quite amount of money considering that this building use to have small local businesses before Adidas plan to move in. The building is owned by landlord Solomon Jacobowitz and he purchased the building along with four others in 2011 for $16.4 Million. If those rent is calculated monthly, landlords will break even their cost less than 2 years.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>The building was originally eyed for a residential conversion. But recently, creative companies are increasingly looking in Williamsburg for office space, and that boosted demand for the creation of such space in the neighborhood. If Adidas really moves in, it will be the first multilateral company moving into this block and that might create whole different impact than 2005 rezoning did.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <center><img src= "images\adidas3.png" width="800"></center>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>The space will serve as a creative office, for three biggest shoe designers Denis Dekovic, Marc Dolce, and Mark Miner to lead the new venture. Those three shoe designers were employees of Nike. Nike launched a lawsuit against three of its former executives. Nike alleged that the designers stole trade secrets and plans when they left the company.  Bringing those three shoe designers and opening creative office in Williamsburg was Adidas’ big move since Nike overtook Adias as the second-largest sportswear maker. Having Adidas studio can be catalyst of office development in northern Williamsburg.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>What was fascinating about this block was that it has all the evidence of change in industries in the neighborhood and how this change in economic base affected the characteristics of the neighborhood. And it was very ironic that the biggest antagonist of gentrification from the Williamsburg Rezoning used to live here and make film about it and now this block is about to take in one of the biggest sports apparel company and about to stark office development in northern Brooklyn.</p>
